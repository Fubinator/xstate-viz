Embedded Mode!

The visualizer/inspector can now be used in the embedded mode. In this mode, some parts of the application can be configured such as control buttons, panning, zooming, etc.
The most important parameter to configure embedded mode it the `mode` that can be one of `viz`, `full` or `panels`.
