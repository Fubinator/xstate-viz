Added a hand icon to the canvas' toolbar:

<img alt="Canvas toolbar with the hand icon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9800850/133060078-30127739-1f8b-47fd-9f2b-308fc3c641bb.png" width="255" />

This allows you to enable the "pan mode" to drag the canvas around without holding the spacebar button down at the same time.
